# Ads Admin Page

The **Ads** screen allows administrators to manage sidebar advertisements displayed on the Events List Page.

- Upload any number of ad images and provide an optional link URL for each.
- On each page load, the Events List Page picks one ad at random to display in the right‑hand column.
- Images are stored as WordPress attachments; only the attachment ID and URL are saved.

Use the **Add Ad** button to insert additional rows. Each row can be removed using the **×** button. Remember to click **Save Ads** when finished. Saved ads immediately clear the plugin cache so the random rotation reflects your changes right away.
