# Event Page Context and Message Center

This document summarizes helper functions and template behavior related to user context on the Event Page.

## Layout Overview

The template uses a three‑column layout—sidebar, main content, and an ad
column—all wrapped in a single `.tta-event-columns` container. The random ad
image sits in the narrow **right** column while the event details sidebar is on
the left and the main content occupies the center.

## Current User Context Helper

`tta_get_current_user_context()` returns information about the visiting user and any linked member record. The data is cached for five minutes to reduce queries.

```php
$context = tta_get_current_user_context();
```

Returned array keys:

- `is_logged_in` – `true` when the user is authenticated.
- `wp_user_id` – WordPress user ID or `0` if not logged in.
- `user_email`, `user_login`, `first_name`, `last_name` – basic profile info.
- `member` – row from the `tta_members` table or `null` if none exists.
- `membership_level` – member level (`free`, `basic`, or `premium`).

## Message Center

The Event Page template includes a **Message Center** block under the “About This Event” section. When a visitor is not logged in a small callout invites them to authenticate. The block begins with a **Log in or Register Here** heading followed by a login form that is visible by default. Clicking **Log in here** toggles the embedded form with the same accordion animation used elsewhere on the page. The form submits via `wp_login_form()` and redirects back to the event page on success. A link to the standard registration page is also provided.

## Event Type and Ticket Context

The **Event Details** sidebar now lists the event type (Open Event, Basic Membership Required, or Premium Membership Required). A short message under the “Get Your Tickets Now” heading communicates the membership requirement and offers login or upgrade links depending on the visitor’s status.

## Social Sharing

Below the event meta information the hero section shows small Facebook and Instagram icons. Clicking either icon opens a share window preloaded with the event title and URL so visitors can quickly post about the event on social media. The behaviour is handled by `event-share.js` which is only loaded on individual Event Pages.

## Your Events Sidebar Section

Between the Venue Links and Refund Policy sections a new **Your Events** block appears. When not logged in it shows a single link prompting visitors to log in. Clicking the link scrolls to the Message Center and automatically expands the login form.
Login expansion happens directly by adding the `expanded` class so the form is open immediately.
The toggle button text remains **Log in here** even after the form expands so the call to action stays consistent.
Scrolling accounts for any fixed header on the site. Adjust the selector in `event-page.js` if your theme uses a different header structure.

Logged-in members instead see links to profile info, upcoming events, past events, and membership/billing details. Each link loads the Member Dashboard with the matching tab active. A log out link is also provided which returns the user to the same event page after signing out.

## Image Gallery

Events can include additional photos displayed in an expandable gallery. The gallery uses a masonry-style layout so images of varying dimensions fit nicely together with minimal gaps.
Each thumbnail uses the same popup script as attendee photos—clicking an image opens a larger version in an overlay.

## Archived Events

When a visitor lands on an event page that no longer exists in the primary
`tta_events` table, the template automatically checks the
`tta_events_archive` table. Archived events display all of the standard details
and retain the attendee gallery. Ticket types come from `tta_tickets_archive`
and attendee profiles load from `tta_attendees_archive`. The **Get Your Tickets
Now** section remains in place but all controls are disabled and a tooltip
explains that ticket sales are closed. Disabled buttons are dimmed with a light
overlay so the tooltip displays at full opacity. The login prompt is suppressed. A small
notice appears above the “About This Event” section letting the visitor know the
event has passed and linking to `/events/` to browse upcoming events.

## Attendee Gallery

Below the image gallery, a second accordion displays profile pictures of confirmed attendees. The list is built from the `tta_attendees` table joined to `tta_members` via email so member profile images can be shown. Results are cached via `TTA_Cache` for ten minutes (one minute when empty). Each attendee's full name appears beneath their photo along with their membership level (Free, Basic, or Premium). If a profile image is missing or attendance is hidden, a placeholder image is shown with a label like "Attendee #1." Hosts and volunteers are highlighted with a small badge over their photo. Hosts are listed first, followed by volunteers, and then all other attendees in alphabetical order.
Membership levels are retrieved by checking each attendee's email against the `tta_members` table, ensuring changes to a member's account are reflected immediately.

Members may opt to hide their attendance in their profile's *Privacy Options*. Hidden attendees always show the placeholder image and use the numbered "Attendee" label.

Attendee thumbnails use the same popup script as the Events List page. Clicking a profile photo opens a larger version in an overlay, which is disabled on very small screens.

## Event Hosts and Volunteers

Admins can assign one or more hosts and volunteers when creating or editing an event. The autocomplete fields pull from members whose type is Volunteer, Admin, or Super Admin. Selected names are stored in the `hosts` and `volunteers` columns of `tta_events`. On the front end, hosts appear first in the attendee gallery followed by volunteers. Each badge is labelled “Host” or “Volunteer.”

## SEO and Schema Markup

Each event page outputs JSON‑LD Event schema. The markup includes the event name, description, dates, location, main image, and pricing when available. This helps search engines display the event in rich results.
