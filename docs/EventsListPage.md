# Events List Page

The **Events List Page** template displays upcoming events in chronological order.
It shows a thumbnail, date, time, venue, address, a short description excerpt and
remaining ticket count for each event. Up to five events are loaded per page with
pagination links generated by `paginate_links()`. The pagination bar displays a
**Previous Events** button on the left, numbered pages centered, and a **More
Events** button on the right.

The layout consists of three columns:

1. **Left column** – a small calendar with arrows to navigate between months. The
   calendar allows browsing three years back and forward. Days that have events
   are highlighted and link to the first event scheduled on that date. Navigation
   happens over AJAX so changing months no longer resets pagination. Above the
   friends box is a **Your Upcoming Events** widget showing events for the logged
   in member and a **Membership Perks** panel encouraging upgrades.
2. **Center column** – the list of upcoming events ordered by date. Each row links
   to the corresponding Event Page. Event images are constrained with `object-fit: contain`
   and are right aligned. Below each event name a list of key details appears with
   the same icons used on individual Event Pages.
3. **Right column** – an advertising slot that displays one random ad image from
   the Ads admin page.

Profile thumbnails within the “Join Your Friends” section open a larger version in a simple popup when clicked. The popup is disabled on very small screens.

On small screens the columns stack vertically for a mobile‑friendly layout.

Use the `events-list-page-template.php` page template from the **Page Attributes**
section when creating a WordPress page. Each list item links to the associated
Event Page. Front‑end styling is provided by `assets/css/frontend/events-list.css`
which is automatically enqueued when this template is active.

The icon and text pairs within `.tta-event-detail-list` are arranged with flexbox
to keep them on a single line. Time strings are parsed safely, so missing or
malformed values no longer trigger PHP warnings.
Cost and event type values are also checked for existence so undefined keys do not generate notices.
