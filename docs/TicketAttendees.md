## Ticket Attendees

The ticket editor displays an **Attendees** section for each ticket. This list
shows every attendee who purchased that ticket in a single table. The table
heading contains **Name**, **Email**, **Phone**, **Paid**, **Refund $** and
**Actions** columns. Each heading includes a tooltip icon explaining the field.
Each attendee occupies one row beneath the heading. The **Paid** column shows
the amount charged for that attendee's ticket. The **Refund $** field lets
admins specify a partial refund before clicking either **Refund & Cancel
Attendance** or **Refund & Keep Attendance**. The first option both issues the
refund and removes the attendee from the event while increasing the available
ticket count. The second option refunds the amount but leaves the attendee
registered. If the transaction has not yet settled, the refund request will
automatically void the original charge instead.
