# Cart and Checkout Flow

This document summarizes the current logic around the cart and checkout process in the Trying To Adult Management Plugin. Future documentation will cover other areas such as creating or editing events and members.

## Overview

1. **Adding Tickets**
   - Visitors interact with the **Event Page** template. When the page loads a `TTA_Cart` instance is created so session data exists early.
   - Ticket details are fetched from the database. Prices vary depending on membership level (`free`, `basic`, or `premium`).
   - Expired cart items are cleared before ticket data loads so availability displays correctly.
   - Whenever a new item is added or a quantity increases, expired reservations are purged to free any leftover stock.
   - Expiration timestamps use WordPress local time so cleanup works consistently across servers.
   - Quantity selectors on the event page prevent selecting more than two tickets in total. A notice appears when the limit would be exceeded. Sold out ticket rows have their quantity controls disabled and the **Get Tickets** button is disabled if no tickets remain.
   - When a user adds tickets, the browser issues an AJAX request to `tta_add_to_cart`. The handler calculates the price, reserves inventory, and calls `TTA_Cart::add_item()`.
   - The AJAX handler now explicitly creates a cart row first via `ensure_cart_exists()` so empty databases start tracking sessions immediately.
   - Cart data is stored in the `tta_carts` and `tta_cart_items` tables keyed by a session ID. Ticket availability is decreased immediately on add and the related event cache is cleared.

2. **Viewing the Cart**
   - The **Cart Page** template renders the current cart contents using `tta_render_cart_contents()`.
   - If a visitor selected a membership on the Become a Member page, that membership appears as its own line item in the cart.
   - Premium members cannot add another membership at all. Attempts to add Basic or Premium memberships are rejected.
   - When the cart only contains a membership, the table hides the **Ticket Reserved for…** column and the first column heading becomes **Event or Item**. Membership pricing shows "Per Month" in the price and subtotal columns, and the total row also displays "Per Month". Column spans adjust so the table remains aligned without the countdown column.
   - If both a membership and tickets are present, the total row displays the first charge (e.g. `$15.00 today, $5 Per Month`) so customers understand future recurring payments.
   - A dedicated **Ticket Reserved for…** column displays a live five minute countdown for ticket rows.
   - The Quantity column enforces a maximum of two tickets per event in total.
   - Discount codes are applied via an **Apply Discount** button. Multiple codes can be active and are split across matching event tickets. Active codes list the related event name in parentheses and appear beneath the cart total for easy removal.
   - The Price column always shows the base cost (e.g. `$20 x 2` when quantity is two). Subtotals strike through the original amount when discounts are applied.
   - Quantity updates that exceed the two ticket limit display an inline notice beside the input.
   - Countdown timers remove items immediately when they expire.
    - Expired items are batched into a single AJAX request so multiple events expiring at once do not overload the database.
    - Timers calculate remaining time from the expiration timestamp so they stay accurate when the tab is hidden.
    - Timers restart after any AJAX update or when the page regains focus.
   - Quantities and discount codes are updated via the `tta_update_cart` AJAX endpoint. This calls `TTA_Cart::update_quantity()` and stores applied codes in the session.
   - When all tickets for an event are removed, any related discount codes are automatically cleared from the session.

3. **Checkout**
   - The **Checkout Page** template performs checkout via an AJAX request (`tta_do_checkout`). The page fades while a spinner shows and always waits at least five seconds before displaying the result under the **Place Order** button.
   - `TTA_Cart::sync_with_inventory()` ensures requested quantities are still available. If inventory changed, a notice is stored and the user is redirected back to the cart.
   - The notice reads, "Some tickets in your cart were no longer available and have been removed. Please review the updated cart and try again."
   - Checkout displays a read-only summary table that mirrors the cart layout with tooltips, countdown timers, and a list of active discount codes below the total.
  - Attendee fields collect a first name, last name, email, and phone for each ticket. A "text me" and "email me" checkbox is included and checked by default. The first ticket for every event autofills with the logged‑in member's details. Those first name, last name, and email fields are displayed but locked from editing. Phone numbers are automatically formatted as the user types.
   - Countdown timers run just like on the cart page. If a timer reaches zero the item is removed and totals update automatically.
   - The `tta_update_cart` AJAX endpoint returns updated markup for both the cart table and checkout summary so timers can refresh either view.
  - Visitors must be logged in to complete checkout. When not authenticated an **Account Required** block appears above the billing fields with AJAX forms for logging in or creating a free account. The login/register section remains interactive while all other attendee and billing inputs are disabled until authentication succeeds and the page reloads.
  - Billing now requires **Street Address**, **Address Line 2**, **City**, **State** and **ZIP** fields. The front-end validates these before the purchase can proceed.
   - A total is calculated with any discount code applied. Payment details for ticket items are sent to `TTA_AuthorizeNet_API::charge()`. If a membership is in the cart, that same charge also bills the first month while `TTA_AuthorizeNet_API::create_subscription()` sets up the recurring payments to start one month later. The returned subscription ID is saved to `tta_members.subscription_id` for future management and the member row is updated so `subscription_status` becomes `active` and `membership_level` matches the purchased plan. Subscriptions are created with consistent names and descriptions based on the chosen level. When tickets and a membership are checked out together, attendee details are still required for the tickets and the subscription is created in the same request. Checkout works even when no tickets are present. The AJAX handler now mirrors this logic so subscriptions are created whether or not JavaScript is enabled.
  - On success, `TTA_Cart::finalize_purchase()` logs the transaction, stores each ticket's attendee info in the `tta_attendees` table, clears the cart tables, removes all discount codes, and triggers the `tta_checkout_complete` action. Inventory has already been reserved when items were added. The checkout page then displays a custom message summarizing any membership purchased and lists the logged‑in member's email along with every unique address entered for ticket attendees. Duplicate addresses are removed and the receipt list only appears when tickets were part of the order. The AJAX response now normalizes the email array so the front‑end receives a proper list when multiple events are purchased in one transaction.

4. **Cleanup**
   - `TTA_Cart_Cleanup` schedules an hourly task and also runs on checkout completion to remove expired cart rows.
   - A second cron task runs every ten minutes to purge expired cart items and free their ticket inventory.
   - Expired items are deleted from carts automatically and their reserved stock is released back to the ticket pool. When this occurs the event ticket cache is also cleared so front‑end counts stay in sync.

## Branching Logic Highlights

- Pricing logic branches on membership level when adding items to the cart.
- Each member may purchase a maximum of two tickets per event. Quantities in the cart plus past purchases are checked during the `tta_add_to_cart` AJAX request.
- Checkout can branch if inventory changes mid-process, redirecting back to the cart with a notice.
 - Payment failure stops checkout and displays the returned error. The plugin now surfaces Authorize.Net error codes and descriptions (for example `11: A duplicate transaction has been submitted`). If the code is recognized, an extra sentence explains what it means.
- Successful completion empties the cart and fires hooks for additional actions (e.g., ticket emails).

This flow will evolve as more features are added. Additional documentation for creating events, editing events, managing members, and other future functionality will live alongside this document in the `docs/` directory.
