# Trying To Adult Management Plugin

This plugin integrates with Authorize.Net for payment processing. The plugin's files live in `app/public/wp-content/plugins/tta-management-plugin` within this repository. For development you may place the API credentials in an `authnet-config.php` file at the plugin root or set them as environment variables before WordPress loads:

```
define('TTA_AUTHNET_LOGIN_ID', 'your_login_id');
define('TTA_AUTHNET_TRANSACTION_KEY', 'your_transaction_key');
# Optional: set to 'false' for production
define('TTA_AUTHNET_SANDBOX', true);
```
If these constants are not defined, checkout will fail and an admin notice will be displayed. When deploying to production, move the credentials out of the plugin directory.

Old events are automatically moved to an `tta_events_archive` table by a daily cron. The process is transparent to admins and members.
Whenever the structure of `tta_events` changes, mirror those updates to `tta_events_archive` as well.

## Running Tests

After installing PHP and Composer, execute `composer install` followed by
`vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the plugin's unit tests.
