# TODOs

A running list of tasks and reminders for future development.

- [x] Test the scenario where cart items become unavailable mid-checkout and display a clear notice to users.
- [ ] Create a referral program page (`/referral-program`) and implement a one-time referral discount code that can be applied to any event.
- [ ] Move Authorize.Net credentials out of `authnet-config.php` before deploying to production.
- [ ] Implement sending logic for the Email & SMS templates and handle token replacement.
- [ ] Ensure internal links use relative URLs so deployments work across domains.
- [ ] Keep `tta_events_archive` schema in sync with `tta_events` whenever changes are made.
